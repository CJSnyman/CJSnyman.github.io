                    <h4>Store Assistant</h4>
                    <p>After school I worked at Rumax, an agricultural equipment supplier, as a store assistant. In my
                        time with Rumax I realized how interested I am in the operations. The fact that I could see the
                        equipment building process from beginning to end was awesome. It is here that I learned, I enjoy
                        the journey much more than the destination.</p>
