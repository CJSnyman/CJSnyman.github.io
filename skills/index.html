                <h4>Python (Pygame) - 2019</h4>
                <p>While playing game on my phone the thought came to me. What if I made a game instead of just playing
                    it? I started doing research on beginner friendly programming languages. In my research I found that
                    most people recommend Python for beginners. After doing more research on it's capabilities and
                    game_libraries, I do decided to give it a go.</p>
                <h4>Coreldraw - 2022</h4>
                <p>I first learned about Coreldraw while working at Apple Graphics. While there the program always
                    interested me. In 2022 when 1 of the designers quit I was given the opportunity to take her place. I
                    was tasked with creating art for the laser i operated. I have since continued desinging for friends
                    and family.</p>

                <h4>Blogger - 2023</h4>
                <p>In the middle of the year 2022 I started thinking about the future and how uncrtain it is.
                    Thinking
                    about this uncertainty lead me to side hustles that can atleast help make my financial future
                    more
                    stable. Time went by and at the end of the year I decided on doing 2 things, blogging and
                    creating
                    YouTube videos. I have started blogging prior to this, but stopped. So I went back to the blog
                    called <a href="https://living-finance.blogspot.com/?m=1">Living Finance</a> and started again.
                    I
                    have decided to do atleast 5 posts per month.</p>
                <h4>YouTube Creator - 2023</h4>
                <p>I started my channel called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@StillCounting">Just Counting</a>
                    after I
                    started blogging. I have since uploaded a video every Monday. I have incorporated my Coreldraw
                    skills and designed the artwork for the channel.</p>

                <h4>HTML - 2023</h4>
                <p>After struggling with customizing the blog pages, I just decided to rather create my own pages. HTML
                    was the obvious choice for me and with my knowledge of programming I didn't experience HTML as
                    Greek.</p>
                <h4>CSS - 2023</h4>
                <p>With HTML came CSS. While working on HTML I'm slowly learning CSS. As I improve my HTML and CSS
                    skills, so will this website improve.</p>
