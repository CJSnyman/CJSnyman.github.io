                    <h4>Python (Pygame) - 2019</h4>
                    <p>While playing game on my phone the thought came to me. What if I made a game instead of just
                        playing
                        it? I started doing research on beginner friendly programming languages. In my research I found
                        that
                        most people recommend Python for beginners. After doing more research on it's capabilities and
                        game libraries, I decided to give it a go.</p>

                    <h4>Coreldraw - 2022</h4>
                    <p>I first learned about Coreldraw while working at Apple Graphics. While there the program always
                        interested me. In 2022 when 1 of the designers quit I was given the opportunity to take her
                        place. I was tasked with creating art for the laser I operated. I have since continued designing for
                        friends and family.</p>

                    <h4>Blogger - 2023</h4>
                    <p>In the middle of the year 2022 I started thinking about the future and how uncrtain it is.
                        Thinking about this uncertainty lead me to side hustles that can atleast help make my financial
                        future more stable. Time went by and at the end of the year I decided on doing 2 things,
                        blogging and creating YouTube videos. I have started blogging prior to this, but stopped. So I
                        went back to the blog called <a href="https://living-finance.blogspot.com/?m=1">Living
                        Finance</a> and started again. I have decided to do atleast 5 posts per month.</p>

                    <h4>YouTube Creator - 2023</h4>
                    <p>I started my channel called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@StillCounting">Just Counting</a>
                        after I
                        started blogging. I have since uploaded a video every Monday. I have incorporated my Coreldraw
                        skills and designed the artwork for the channel.</p>

                    <h4>HTML - 2023</h4>
                    <p>After struggling with customizing the blog pages, I just decided to rather create my own pages. HTML
                        was the obvious choice for me and with my knowledge of programming I didn't experience HTML as Greek.</p>

                    <h4>CSS - 2023</h4>
                    <p>With HTML came CSS. While working on HTML I'm slowly learning CSS. As I improve my HTML and CSS
                        skills, so will this website improve.</p>
